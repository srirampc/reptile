The following has been changed in version 1.1

-- More efficient way to record kmer and tiles compared to version 1.0
   Effectively, the total run time has been halved (as tested) 

-- In Parser.cpp file, the following part of code has been changed
	version 1.0 
        int idx = bisearch(snKArray_, snKArray_.size(), nbIDs[i]);
        if (idx != -1){
            if(snKArray_[idx].goodCnt >= myPara.tCard) {
                myNB.push_back(snKArray_[idx]);
            }
        }
	version 1.1
		if (std::binary_search(kArray_.begin(), kArray_.end(), nbIDs[i])){
            myNB.push_back(nbIDs[i]);
        }
   
-- A stand-alone script called reptile_merger is provided to generate the fasta format
   output after Reptile correction. See readme file in reptile_merger for more information
