# If the dataset is too large to fit in memory, it can be read in batches. This
# parameter specifies the number of reads to be loaded into memory for each
# batch. Default value is 1 million.
BatchSize       30

# k-mer length
KmerLen         7

# Maximum Hamming distance per k-mer
hd_max          2

# Tile length = 'KmerLen' + 'Step'    
Step            1

# This controls the run-time and memory,  set to 4^c (1 <= c <= 4); to reduce
# the run time set c to be a smaller value, but memory usage will increase; to
# save memory, increase c value
ExpectSearch    4

# Let t_c be the cardinality of a tile and t_c_prime be the cardinality of the
# most frequently occuring alternative tile. Set 'T_ratio' = t_c / t_c_prime.
# For each tile, if its T_ratio is less than or equal to this threshold, it will
# be corrected to the alternative tile. For example, if the T_ratio is 0.5 and a
# tile occurs 12 times and has an alternative tile that occurs 24 or more times,
# then the tile is corrected to the alternative tile.
T_ratio         0.5


######## The following parameters need to be tuned to specific dataset ########

# A base call > 'QThreshold' is considered high-quality
QThreshold      50

# Maximum number of bases < 'QThreshold' allowed per k-mer. If a k-mer contains    
# <= 'MaxBadQPerKmer' bases having quality < 'QThreshold', it is considered as a
# high quality k-mer. Default value is 0
MaxBadQPerKmer  1

# Lower threshold for ASCII-formatted quality scores. Any quality less than this
# threshold is considered low probability base call.
Qlb             65

# If a tile has a k-mer that occurs with quality more than 'T_expGoodCnt' times,
# it is considered error-free without further validation. Theoretically, if we
# assume random genome sampling and uniform distribution of errors (with error
# rate p_e), then this value would be the following.
# [read_num/(genome_len - read_len + 1)*(read_len - tile_len + 1)] * (1-p_e)^{L}
# See the README file for practical advice on setting this parameter.
T_expGoodCnt    8

# At a minimum, a tile must occur this many times to be considered a "good
# tile." The README file provides advice for selecting this parameter, but it
# can be arbitrarily chosen--assuming you understand the consequences of that
# choice. Increasing this value of this parameter will significantly increase
# specificity (reduce false positives), but at the same time will reduce
# sensitivity (increase false negatives). Because of Reptile's conservative
# approach to error correction, it is suggested that the value of this parameter
# be chosen so as to maximize the size of the output file. The expectation is
# that for each additional false positive, many additional true positives will
# also be found, increasing the overall quality of the data. Also, make sure
# that T_card < T_expGoodCnt.
T_card          1

# If set to 1, the program will store the reads and then 
#  process the reads - Applicable only if run with out map reduce
StoreReads      0
